# About Me

![Profile Image: Professional, approachable headshot](/ketan-portfolio/assets/ketan-headshot.svg)

## I design with logic, insight, and an innate curiosity.

I am a **Product Designer** with a background in Information Science and Human-Computer Interaction. I specialize in untangling complex systems and designing tools that empower users to handle data, compliance, and heavy workflows.

Currently, I design enterprise-grade software at **Appian**, focusing on the Case Management platform. My work involves taking abstract technical requirements—often in high-compliance industries like Financial Services—and translating them into clear, usable interfaces.

### The Foundation
My approach to design is academic and evidence-based. I hold a **Master of Science in Information Science** with a specialization in **Human-Computer Interaction Design**.

During my graduate studies, I wrote a thesis examining user behaviors, which cemented my belief that good design isn't just about intuition—it’s about research. I don't just guess what a user needs; I dig into the data, interview the stakeholders, and map the workflows to ensure the solution is grounded in reality.

My undergraduate background in **Philosophy** complements this by providing the logical framework for my decisions. It gave me the critical thinking skills to deconstruct problems and the persistence to ask "why" until I understand the root cause.

## My Approach

### 1. Grounded in Evidence
I believe the best design decisions are the ones you can justify. Whether it's through usability testing, heuristic evaluation, or deep-dive discovery, I rely on insights to guide my hand.

### 2. Solving the Right Problem
I have a desire to solve problems, not just patch them. I invest time in the discovery phase to ensure we aren't just shipping a feature, but actually fixing the underlying friction for the user.

### 3. Logic over Decoration
In enterprise software, clarity is the ultimate metric. I prioritize robust information architecture and accessibility (**WCAG 2.1 AA**) over flashy trends. If the logic of the application isn't sound, the UI won't save it.
