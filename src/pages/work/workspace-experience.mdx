  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: #475569;">The Workspace is the front-end interface where case workers review information, make decisions, and interact with external users.</p>
</div>

<StatGrid stats={[
  { value: "100%", label: "WCAG 2.1 Compliant" },

### Adoption and Scale
* **Global Validation:** The interface drives daily operations for major organizations including **Porsche, Pfizer, and the Australian Government**.
* **Accelerated Deployment:** Because the workspace UI is dynamically created from Studio configurations, customers avoided the months typically spent designing custom user interfaces. This allowed organizations to go live with a modern experience using the latest design patterns significantly faster than legacy builds.
* **Operational Improvement:** The introduction of the authenticated "My Cases" site offloaded a significant volume of manual "status check" emails, allowing internal teams to shift focus from support tickets to high-value case resolution.

      <h3>Disconnected Data</h3>
      <p>Case management requires coordinating information from disparate sources—emails, documents, external sites, and internal databases.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fragmentation:</strong> Employees struggle to find the single source of truth needed to make the right decisions. Without a system enforcing specific rules, cases can fall through the cracks.</p>
      <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Design a unified workspace site that centralizes all case information, enforces business logic defined in Studio, and uses AI to accelerate decision-making.</p>

      <p>To solve the fragmentation issue, the case record aggregates all necessary context into one view.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Case Summary:</strong> Upon opening a case, the user sees a consolidated view of the description, milestones, watchers, and critical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Layouts:</strong> While the core navigation structure remains consistent for usability, the system dynamically renders case-specific forms and data fields based on Studio configurations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Inclusive & Accessible:</strong> I ensured the entire workspace experience was fully responsive and compliant with <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA standards</strong>, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation.</p>

      <p>We integrated Private AI to help case workers process large volumes of information without leaving the context of the case.</p>

        <li><strong>Document Summarization:</strong> Instead of reading 50-page PDFs, users can ask the AI to "Summarize the key claims in this document," receiving an instant, citation-backed answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual Chat:</strong> A secure AI chat panel allows users to query the case history (e.g., "Has this customer requested a refund before?") to make faster, evidence-based decisions.</li>

      <p>Case management isn't just internal. We extended the Workspace to external users via secure, authenticated portals.</p>
      <p><strong>"My Cases" Site:</strong> This self-service portal allows citizens or customers to log in, view the status of their requests, upload missing documents, and communicate directly with case workers.</p>
      <p><strong>The Result:</strong> This direct access drastically reduced the volume of "What is my status?" emails, freeing up case workers to focus on resolution.</p>
