### 1. The Impact: User Adoption and Scale
The Workspace is the front-end interface where case workers review information, make decisions, and interact with external users.

* **Global Validation:** The interface drives daily operations for major organizations including **Porsche, Pfizer, and the Australian Government**.
* **Accelerated Deployment:** Because the workspace UI is dynamically created from Studio configurations, customers avoided the months typically spent designing custom user interfaces. This allowed organizations to go live with a modern experience using the latest design patterns significantly faster than legacy builds.
* **Operational Improvement:** The introduction of the authenticated "My Cases" site offloaded a significant volume of manual "status check" emails, allowing internal teams to shift focus from support tickets to high-value case resolution.

### 2. The Challenge: Disconnected Data
**The Context:** Case management requires coordinating information from disparate sources—emails, documents, external sites, and internal databases.
**The Problem:** Legacy processes often rely on manual tracking across these disconnected systems.
* **Fragmentation:** Employees struggle to find the single source of truth needed to make the right decisions.
* **Governance Risks:** Without a system enforcing specific rules, cases can fall through the cracks or fail to meet compliance standards.
* **Inefficient Communication:** Resolving a case often requires back-and-forth communication across departments and external organizations, which is difficult to track in standard email inboxes.

**The Goal:** Design a unified workspace site that centralizes all case information, enforces business logic defined in Studio, and uses AI to accelerate decision-making.

### 3. The Solution: A Centralized System

#### A. Centralized Information
To solve the fragmentation issue, the case record aggregates all necessary context into one view.
* **Inclusive & Accessible:** I ensured the entire workspace experience was fully responsive and compliant with **WCAG 2.1 AA standards**, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation. This was a critical requirement for our public sector clients (like the Australian Government) to serve diverse workforce needs.
* **Dynamic Layouts:** While the core navigation and dashboard structure remain consistent to ensure usability, the system dynamically renders case-specific forms and data fields based on Studio configurations.
* **The Case Summary:** Upon opening a case, the user sees a consolidated view of the description, milestones, watchers, and critical data.
