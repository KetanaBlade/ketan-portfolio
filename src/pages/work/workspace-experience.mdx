  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--color-text-muted);">The Workspace is the front-end interface where case workers review information, make decisions, and interact with external users.</p>
</div>

<StatGrid stats={[

### Adoption and Scale
* **Global Validation:** The interface drives daily operations for major organizations including **Porsche, Pfizer, and the Australian Government**.
* **Accelerated Deployment:** Because the workspace UI is dynamically created from Studio configurations, customers avoided the months typically spent designing custom user interfaces. This allowed organizations to go live with a modern experience using the latest design patterns significantly faster than legacy builds.
* **Operational Improvement:** The introduction of the authenticated "My Cases" site offloaded a significant volume of manual "status check" emails, allowing internal teams to shift focus from support tickets to high-value case resolution.

      <h3>Disconnected Data</h3>
      <p>Case management requires coordinating information from disparate sources—emails, documents, external sites, and internal databases.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fragmentation:</strong> Employees struggle to find the single source of truth needed to make the right decisions. Without a system enforcing specific rules, cases can fall through the cracks.</p>
      <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Design a unified workspace site that centralizes all case information, enforces business logic defined in Studio, and uses AI to accelerate decision-making.</p>

      <p>To solve the fragmentation issue, the case record aggregates all necessary context into one view.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Case Summary:</strong> Upon opening a case, the user sees a consolidated view of the description, milestones, watchers, and critical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Layouts:</strong> While the core navigation structure remains consistent for usability, the system dynamically renders case-specific forms and data fields based on Studio configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>Industry Agnostic:</strong> The interface is designed to be framework-agnostic. Whether configured for <strong>government permitting</strong> or <strong>commercial insurance</strong>, the workspace adapts its layout and logic while maintaining a consistent, accessible user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Inclusive & Accessible:</strong> The entire workspace experience is fully responsive and compliant with <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA standards</strong>, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation.</p>

      <p>Case management isn't just for internal users. The design of the external experience ensures that public interaction with government and enterprise services is seamless, secure, and accessible on any device.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Portals:</strong> A mobile-first entry point for anonymous users to discover services, find information, and begin the application process.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Intake:</strong> A guided "no-login" submission flow that allows users to submit cases quickly while ensuring data integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticated Self-Service:</strong> Once signed up, the "My Cases" dashboard allows users to track their progress, upload missing documents, and communicate directly with case workers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Mobile-First Accessibility:</strong> Since external users often access these services via mobile devices, a responsive design that met <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA standards</strong> was prioritized. This ensured that critical services were usable for everyone, regardless of their device or ability.</p>
