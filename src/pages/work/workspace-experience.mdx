  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--color-text-muted);">The Workspace is the front-end interface where case workers review information, make decisions, and interact with external users.</p>

### Adoption and Scale
* **Global Validation:** The interface drives daily operations for major organizations including **Porsche, Pfizer, and the Australian Government**.
* **Accelerated Deployment:** Because the workspace UI is dynamically created from Studio configurations, customers avoided the months typically spent designing custom user interfaces. This allowed organizations to go live with a **modern experience** using the latest design patterns **significantly faster than legacy builds**.
* **Operational Improvement:** The introduction of the authenticated "My Cases" site **offloaded a significant volume of manual "status check" emails**, allowing internal teams to shift focus from support tickets to high-value case resolution.

      <h3>Disconnected Data</h3>
      <p>Case management requires coordinating information from disparate sources—emails, documents, external sites, and internal databases.</p>
      <p><strong>The Fragmentation:</strong> Employees struggle to find the <strong>single source of truth</strong> needed to make the right decisions. Without a system enforcing specific rules, <strong>cases can fall through the cracks</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> Design a unified workspace site that <strong>centralizes all case information</strong>, enforces business logic defined in Studio, and <strong>uses AI to accelerate decision-making</strong>.</p>

        <li><strong>Industry Agnostic:</strong> The interface is designed to be framework-agnostic. Whether configured for <strong>government permitting</strong> or <strong>commercial insurance</strong>, the workspace <strong>adapts its layout and logic</strong> while maintaining a consistent, accessible user experience.</li>

      <p><strong>Inclusive & Accessible:</strong> The entire workspace experience is fully responsive and compliant with <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA standards</strong>, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation.</p>

        <h4>Designing for Relevance</h4>
        <p>A core tenet of the design was to keep the application focused. We adopted a <strong>modular architecture</strong> as a result of close collaboration between business, development, and design. This ensured that the interface only displays <strong>features relevant to a specific configuration</strong>, preventing the unnecessary complexity common in legacy software while maintaining a scalable codebase.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intentional Layouts:</strong> Foundational decisions like navigation placement were validated through testing. While the Studio environment uses a sidebar for its deep hierarchy, users confirmed that a <strong>top navigation model</strong> was better for the Workspace, as it <strong>preserved horizontal space</strong> for reviewing data and documents.</li>
          <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Participants in usability studies reacted positively to this streamlined approach. They noted the interface felt cleaner than previous iterations and confirmed that the layout successfully aggregated necessary details without overwhelming the user.</li>
          <li><strong>Result:</strong> The final design provides a unified interface that remains flexible enough to support diverse business needs while keeping the worker focused on the task at hand.</li>

        <h4>Shifting the Design Language</h4>
        <p>While the internal workspace focused on density and efficiency for trained experts, the external portal required a fundamental shift in design language to support novice users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consumer-Friendly UX:</strong> We simplified the interaction model, breaking down complex intake forms into <strong>guided, bite-sized steps</strong>. The visual style was adjusted to be more welcoming and less enterprise, using <strong>clearer typography and more generous spacing</strong> to reduce cognitive load.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile-First Strategy:</strong> Recognizing that citizens often access services via smartphones, the entire self-service experience was designed mobile-first. This ensured that critical flows—like <strong>self-registration and case tracking</strong>—were fully functional and accessible on <strong>smaller touch screens</strong>, not just scaled-down desktop views.</li>
          <li><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> Special attention was paid to the handoff between unauthenticated public access and authenticated self-service, ensuring that the transition from initial discovery to secure account management felt like a single, cohesive journey.</li>
