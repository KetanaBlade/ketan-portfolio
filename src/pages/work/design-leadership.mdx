    <p>When I joined, the team relied on Sketch, which created friction in developer handoff and made maintaining our complex UI library difficult. I saw an opportunity to modernize our delivery workflow.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Strategy:</strong> I initiated a "Figma Hackathon" to evaluate if the tool could streamline building out Appian SAIL as usable design components. We needed to verify that features like <strong>Auto Layout and Variants</strong> offered a tangible efficiency gain over our legacy Sketch symbols.</li>
      <li><strong>The Execution:</strong> Following the successful pilot, I established and led the <strong>Figma Library Working Group</strong>. We rebuilt our design system from the ground up, optimizing the components to behave like their code counterparts.</li>
      <li><strong>The Impact:</strong> This initiative grew beyond internal use. We published the <strong>"Appian SAIL Design System"</strong> to the Figma Community, where it has been adopted by nearly <strong>1,000 external users</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As the team expanded, I took an active role in shaping how new designers integrate into the complex world of enterprise software.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design Rotations:</strong> I managed rotations for new hires, acting as their primary partner to help them navigate the transition from general UX principles to Appian’s specific low-code constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Intern Program:</strong> During the summer months, I stepped in to facilitate our intern onboarding curriculum. My focus was on operationalizing their ramp-up time—ensuring they could move from "learning the tool" to "shipping a feature" within their short tenure.</li>

  <h2>The UX Chapter</h2>
</div>

<div class="culture-split">
  <div class="text">
    <p>I lead the <strong>UX Chapter</strong>, a monthly internal forum dedicated to raising the team’s collective bar through peer-to-peer learning. Since 2023, I have facilitated 34 sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>The Shift:</strong> I noticed early sessions had become passive lectures with low engagement. I restructured the format to focus on <strong>interactive workshops</strong>, where designers sign up to lead deep dives into new tools, emerging design standards, or conference takeaways.</p>
    <p><strong>The Outcome:</strong> This shift democratized knowledge sharing. Instead of relying on a few seniors to teach, every designer now contributes to the curriculum, fostering a culture where continuous learning is a shared responsibility.</p>
