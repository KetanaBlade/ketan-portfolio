### 1. Modernizing Design Operations (The Figma Journey)
When I joined, the team relied on Sketch, which created friction in developer handoff and made maintaining our complex UI library difficult. I saw an opportunity to modernize our delivery workflow.

* **The Strategy:** I initiated a "Figma Hackathon" to evaluate if the tool could streamline building out Appian SAIL as usable design components. We needed to verify that features like Auto Layout and Variants offered a tangible efficiency gain over our legacy Sketch symbols before committing to a migration.
* **The Execution:** Following the successful pilot, I established and led the **Figma Library Working Group**. We rebuilt our design system from the ground up, optimizing the components to behave like their code counterparts to reduce overhead for the design team.
* **The Impact:** This initiative grew beyond internal use. We published the **"Appian SAIL Design System"** to the Figma Community, where it has been adopted by hundreds of external customers and partners to accelerate their own build times.

### 2. Mentorship & Onboarding
As the team expanded, I took an active role in shaping how new designers integrate into the complex world of enterprise software.

* **Rotations:** I managed design rotations for new hires, acting as their primary partner to help them navigate the transition from general UX principles to Appian’s specific low-code constraints.
* **Intern Program:** During the summer months, I stepped in to facilitate our intern onboarding curriculum. My focus was on operationalizing their ramp-up time—ensuring they could move from "learning the tool" to "shipping a feature" within their short tenure.

### 3. Cultivating Knowledge (UX Chapter)
I lead the **UX Chapter**, a monthly internal forum dedicated to raising the team’s collective bar.

* **The Shift:** I noticed early sessions had become passive lectures with low engagement. I restructured the format to focus on **interactive workshops**, where designers sign up to lead deep dives into new tools, emerging design standards, or conference takeaways.
* **The Outcome:** This shift democratized knowledge sharing. Instead of relying on a few seniors to teach, every designer now contributes to the curriculum, fostering a culture where continuous learning is a shared responsibility.
