  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--color-text-muted);">Institutional Onboarding is a high-stakes domain where <strong>speed is revenue, but accuracy is the law</strong>. This suite of applications replaced fragmented legacy processes with a unified system.</p>

### Visibility & Velocity
* **Unified Data Architecture:** By interlinking **Customer, Onboarding, Product, and Service Request** records, the solution broke down data silos. Operations teams could finally navigate from a high-level Customer record down to a specific Product fee structure without losing context.
* **Client Validation:** The robust architecture allowed major institutions like **T. Rowe Price and Vanguard** to adopt the solution with significantly fewer customizations, as the core product successfully handled their complex requirements out of the box.
* **Compliance & Accessibility:** Strict **WCAG 2.1 AA standards** were advocated for and implemented across the platform. Given the regulatory nature of financial services, ensuring the software was usable by all employees and auditable for compliance was non-negotiable.

      <h3>Inheriting a Monolith</h3>
      <p>I inherited a massive, highly regulated application suite that had grown into a monolith. The system was powerful but suffered from deep usability debt.</p>
      <p><strong>The Logic Problem:</strong> Configuring workflows was error-prone. Usability studies revealed that the legacy "Precedents" model (defining what came <em>before</em>) forced users to think backward. <strong>100% of participants</strong> failed to configure conditional logic correctly in early tests because the UI didn't match their sequential "flowchart" thinking.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data Problem:</strong> Users had to manually cross-reference spreadsheets to know if a specific "Hedge Fund" customer had provided the necessary "KYC Documents" for a specific "Derivatives Product."</p>

      <p>Financial institutions need a command center that balances high-level status with deep compliance tracking. The Onboarding Dashboard was designed to act as this single source of truth.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified Risk & Funding:</strong> The dashboard aggregates critical indicators—overall risk status, funding status, and milestone progress—into a "at-a-glance" summary, allowing managers to instantly identify at-risk onboardings.</li>
        <li><strong>Specialized Document Handling:</strong> Compliance relies on documentation. The system treats documents as first-class citizens, allowing users to upload, tag, and verify KYC/AML documents directly within the context of the onboarding, complete with version control and audit trails.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To handle the complexity of compliance workflows (KYC/AML), the configuration experience was redesigned to match the user's mental model.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From Precedents to Dependents:</strong> We flipped the interaction model. Instead of asking "What allows this task to start?", the UI now asks "What happens <em>after</em> this task finishes?" We also completely overhauled validations, moving from generic error messages to precise, targeted feedback located directly on the affected field.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Branching:</strong> Complex logic like loops and conditional branches were previously hidden in deep menus. We surfaced these as primary actions, allowing users to easily configure "If/Then" scenarios (like loopbacks for missing documents) without needing to understand the underlying code structure.</li>

      <p>The onboarding process often stalls when waiting for customer input. To reduce friction, a dedicated Customer Portal was designed to give external users a clear, actionable view of their responsibilities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Instead of relying on email chains, customers can log in to see exactly where they stand in the process. The dashboard highlights outstanding tasks and provides a clear timeline of next steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlined Action:</strong> Complex requirements are broken down into bite-sized tasks. Whether it's uploading a proof of address or digitally signing a contract, users can complete actions directly within the secure portal without navigating confusing menus.</li>
