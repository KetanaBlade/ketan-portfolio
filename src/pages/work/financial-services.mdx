  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: #475569;">Institutional Onboarding is a high-stakes domain where speed is revenue, but accuracy is the law. This suite of applications replaced fragmented legacy processes with a unified system.</p>

### Visibility & Velocity
* **Unified Data Architecture:** By interlinking **Customer, Onboarding, Product, and Service Request** records, the solution broke down data silos. Operations teams could finally navigate from a high-level Customer record down to a specific Product fee structure without losing context.
* **Client Validation:** The robust architecture allowed major institutions like **T. Rowe Price and Vanguard** to adopt the solution with significantly fewer customizations, as the core product successfully handled their complex requirements out of the box.

    <div slot="text">
      <h3>Inheriting a Monolith</h3>
      <p>I inherited a massive, highly regulated application suite that had grown into a monolith. The system was powerful but suffered from deep usability debt.</p>
      <p><strong>The Logic Problem:</strong> Configuring workflows was error-prone. Usability studies revealed that the legacy "Precedents" model (defining what came <em>before</em>) forced users to think backward. <strong>100% of participants</strong> failed to configure conditional logic correctly in early tests because the UI didn't match their sequential "flowchart" thinking.</p>
      <p><strong>The Data Problem:</strong> Users had to manually cross-reference spreadsheets to know if a specific "Hedge Fund" customer had provided the necessary "KYC Documents" for a specific "Derivatives Product."</p>

    <div slot="text">
      <p>I designed a system of connected Record Views to ensure users always had context, regardless of where they entered the application.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Customer Record:</strong> A master view aggregating all relationships. A user can land on "Acme Corp" and instantly see active Onboardings, open Service Requests, and existing Products.</li>
        <li><strong>The Onboarding Dashboard:</strong> A specialized view for the active lifecycle. It aggregates the Summary (health and funding status), Products (fee structures), and Documents (tracking "Missing" vs. "Approved" status) into a single location.</li>
      </ul>

  <TwoCol frame={true}>
    <div slot="text">
      <p>To handle the complexity of compliance workflows (KYC/AML), I led the redesign of the configuration experience to match the user's mental model.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>From Precedents to Dependents:</strong> We flipped the interaction model. Instead of asking "What allows this task to start?", the UI now asks "What happens <em>after</em> this task finishes?" This aligned with the user's natural sequential thinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualizing Complexity:</strong> We moved "Conditional Logic" out of hidden menus and into the primary grid. Users can now visualize branching paths (e.g., "If Risk = High, Trigger Enhanced Due Diligence") directly in the setup wizard.</li>

      <p>To ensure data integrity, I designed a wizard-driven "Create New Onboarding" flow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Requirements:</strong> The system automatically calculates required documents and tasks based on the data entered (e.g., selecting a "UK Region" automatically requires "GDPR Checks"), reducing manual error.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance & Accessibility:</strong> I advocated for and implemented strict <strong>WCAG 2.1 AA standards</strong> across the intake wizards. Given the regulatory nature of financial services, ensuring the software was usable by all employees and auditable for compliance was non-negotiable.</li>
