## Key Projects & Case Studies

### 1. The Studio Experience (Low-Code Platform)
- **Problem:** Legacy linear checklists failed to represent complex business lifecycles.
- **Solution:** A hybrid three-pane interface (Input, Logic, Validation) that bridges spreadsheet efficiency with flowchart visualization.
- **Outcome:** Reduced engineering dependency, allowing implementation teams to go live in as little as 4 weeks.

### 2. The Workspace Experience (AI & Dynamic Interfaces)
- **Problem:** Case workers faced fragmented data across emails, documents, and databases.
- **Solution:** A unified, intelligent front-end aggregating case context with integrated **Private AI** for summarization and discovery.
- **Accessibility:** 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliant; mobile-first design for public-facing portals.

### 3. Connected Onboarding (Financial Services)
- **Problem:** Inherited a monolith with 300+ tasks where users struggled with a "backward" thinking precedent model.
- **Solution:** Flipped the interaction model to "sequential thinking" (dependents vs. precedents) and built a command-center dashboard for risk/compliance tracking.
- **Impact:** Adopted by Tier 1 financial institutions with minimal customization.

### 4. Design Leadership & Operations
- **Figma Migration:** Led the transition from Sketch to Figma, rebuilding the design system to optimize for Auto Layout and Variants.
- **Mentorship:** Established onboarding curriculum and design rotations for new hires and interns.
